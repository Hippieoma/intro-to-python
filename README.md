# Introduction to Python

The purpose of this repository is to serve as an interactive "book" for
studying Python.

All examples and case studies are created with the **goal to prepare** the
student for further courses in the big and young field of **data science**.

The "chapters" are written as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which
are a de-facto standard for exchanging code and results among data science
professionals and researchers. As such they can be viewed in a plain web
browser (just click on the links in the list above).

However, it is recommended to **install Python and Jupyter locally** and run
the notebooks. This way, the student can play with the code and learn more
efficiently. Precise **installation instructions** are in the
[0th notebook](0_start_up.ipynb).

Feedback is encouraged and will be incorporated.
